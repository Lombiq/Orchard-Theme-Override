# Theme Override Orchard module Theme



## About

This Orchard module adds configuration to the admin page that lets override the styling of the current theme (works with tenants too).


## Features:

- Adds a configuration to Themes settings to specify styles that can override the theme's
- Works in a multi-tenant environment too, so you can provide tenants customization for their theme


## Installation and usage

**This module needs at least Orchard 1.8!**

After enabling the module ads a tab to the Themes page on the admin site. You can set up a stylesheet there that will be included last, so you can override any styling there.

**See the [Version history](Docs/VersionHistory.md).**

The module is also available for [DotNest](http://dotnest.com/) sites.

You can install the module from the [Gallery](http://gallery.orchardproject.net/List/Modules/Orchard.Module.Piedone.ThemeOverride).
